This project is for showcasing the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles and for practicing those principles for me.
This project is a Library Management system with a a terminal interface for users to interact with the system, 
including options to add books to the library, register new members, borrow and return books, display book and member information, 
and test the system for failure states, such as attempting to borrow a book that is already checked out or registering a member with invalid information.
It uses Classes and Interfaces and other features to showcase the OOP principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
It also for the most part demonstrate the SOLID principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
, Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
These OOP principles guide the design and development of maintainable, reusable, and scalable software solutions.

Thank you for taking the time of looking at my first, hopefully of many, projects that I will post for my GitHub Portfolio.
