README: Library Management System

This project is designed to showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and provide an opportunity to practice applying them.

The project implements a Library Management System with a terminal-based interface that allows users to interact with the system. Key features include:

    Adding books to the library
    Registering new members
    Borrowing and returning books
    Displaying book and member information
    Handling failure states, such as borrowing a book that is already checked out or registering a member with invalid information

The project makes use of classes, interfaces, and other OOP features to demonstrate core principles such as:

    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

Additionally, the project follows the SOLID principles for maintainable and scalable software design:

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

These principles guide the development of software that is maintainable, reusable, and scalable.

Thank you for taking the time to review my first project! I hope this will be the first of many contributions to my GitHub portfolio.
